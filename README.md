# Immich Utils

**Note:** I have forked this from @krauters, in order to add my asset deletion script. Please check out the upstream for the original! I may create a pull request once I'm happy with it.

A collection of scripts designed to interact with the Immich API, making it easier to manage and streamline your Immich instance. Immich, the best local image hosting server around (see [immich.app](https://immich.app/)), provides powerful tools for managing your media locally, and this project takes full advantage of it.

These utilities heavily rely on the robust [@immich/sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@immich/sdk), so you get all the power of the Immich API wrapped in simple, no-frills scripts. Whether you need to handle bulk operations, like deleting files based on their suffix, or automate routine tasks, these utilities will save you time and effort.
